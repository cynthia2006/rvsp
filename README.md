# rvsp
rvsp is an audio spectrum visualizer in Rust, drawing inspiration from [techniques used in WebAudio API][1]. It is GPU accelarated with 8x MSAA. It is more of a hobby project, intended to serve as sort of a demo; for serious needs, checkout [ProjectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm).

## Controls

<kbd>k</kbd> to amplify spectrum, and <kbd>j</kbd> to attenuate spectrum.
